## Bangor autoglosser

The code here was produced to POS-tag the [conversational corpora](http://bangortalk.org.uk) assembled by the ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory & Practice at University of Wales Bangor.

The data was bilingual conversational running text, and the autoglosser tags it in one pass based on constraint grammar linguistic rules for each language.

Note that this code is not really packaged properly: because a lot of the work was done ad hoc, it's more like a compendium of things that worked for us. (To get a smaller, cleaner implementation, try the [GÃ¡idhlig autoglosser](http://kevindonnelly.org.uk/gaidhlig).)

This was remedied to some extent in the second version, Autoglosser2, though that was aimed at written Welsh only, rather than the conversational, code-switched, multilingual text in the Bangor corpora.
